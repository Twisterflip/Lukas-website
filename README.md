The apartment was quiet except for the low hum of the fridge and the ticking of the old wall clock that Lukas’s mom had brought with her from Berlin. Outside, the city had started to settle — headlights flickered across the windows, and somewhere in the distance, a siren cried briefly before fading. Lukas, 15 and fresh off a long day of school and basketball practice, dropped his backpack gently by the door. He kicked off his sneakers and walked into the kitchen, where he found his mother exactly where he expected her to be.

She was still in her uniform — her blue nursing scrubs wrinkled from hours of work. Her back was hunched at the table, her blonde hair tied up hastily, her eyes closed as she leaned her head against her hand. A half-filled mug of cold coffee sat untouched beside a pile of unopened mail. She looked older than she should have at 38 — tired in a way that came from years of shouldering life alone.

Lukas didn’t say anything at first. He stood in the doorway for a second, just watching her, feeling that familiar mix of love and helplessness twist in his chest. He knew she was doing everything she could — two jobs, barely sleeping, just to keep the rent paid and his basketball dreams alive.

He moved quietly, opening cabinets, pulling out a small pot to reheat the leftover lentil stew she’d made the night before. The moment the burner clicked on, her eyes fluttered open.

“Lukus?” she said softly, her German accent still thick around the vowels.

“Yeah, Mama. Just heating up dinner. You didn’t eat yet, did you?”

She shook her head, slowly sitting up straighter. “You should be resting.”

He smiled — not wide, not for show, just a tired, knowing curve of the lips. “So should you.”

There was a pause between them — filled with silence but not emptiness. The kind of silence built on quiet understanding. He dished the food gently into a bowl and placed it in front of her with a fork and napkin, then sat across the table. She looked at the meal, then at him, and her eyes shimmered, glassy with tears she refused to let fall.

“I don’t say it enough,” she whispered. “But I’m proud of you.”

Lukas swallowed hard. He didn’t need to hear it — he saw it in every long shift she worked, every game she cheered for after no sleep, every secondhand jersey she cleaned like it was brand new.

“I know,” he said. And he meant it.

That night, Lukas didn’t finish his homework. He didn’t scroll his phone or watch game highlights. Instead, he sat with his mother while she ate, sharing quiet words and warmer silences. He knew he couldn’t take away her exhaustion, but he could carry a little of it for her — in quiet ways, in small moments, where love didn’t have to shout to be heard.
